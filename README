## Global Refinement of Random Forest

Our goal was to solve the tasks of classification and regression a popular learning method; random forest. In our project, we focused on the work described in [this article] (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2015/html/Ren_Global_Refinement_of_2015_CVPR_paper.html), which suggests adding the steps of global refinement and global pruning to optimize the results.
